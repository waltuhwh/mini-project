                    <p>
                        Ingredients:

                        2 cups all-purpose flour (maida)
                        1 tablespoon oil
                        1 teaspoon salt
                        Water, as needed
                        Ghee or oil, for cooking
                        Instructions:
                        
                        Preparing the Dough:
                        In a large mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, oil, and salt.
                        Gradually add water little by little and knead the mixture into a smooth and soft dough. The dough should be firm but pliable.
                        Once the dough is well-kneaded, cover it with a damp cloth or plastic wrap and let it rest for about 30 minutes to 1 hour. This resting time helps in making the parottas soft and stretchy.
                        Dividing and Rolling:
                        After resting, divide the dough into equal-sized balls. Roll each ball between your palms to make them smooth.
                        Take one dough ball and flatten it slightly with your hands. Dip it in flour and place it on a clean, flat surface.
                        Using a rolling pin, roll out the dough ball into a thin, flat disc. Try to roll it as thin as possible without tearing it.
                        Once rolled out, spread a little ghee or oil evenly over the surface of the rolled-out dough.
                        Layering and Folding:
                        Start pleating/folding the rolled-out dough from one end to form thin layers. This technique helps in creating the flaky texture of the parotta.
                        Once pleated, coil the folded dough into a tight spiral shape (similar to a cinnamon roll).
                        Tuck the end of the coil underneath to secure it and flatten the coil slightly with your hands.
                        Rolling and Shaping:
                        Take the coiled dough and gently flatten it with your hands. Dip it in flour and roll it out again into a thin, flat disc, taking care not to break the layers.
                        Repeat the process with the remaining dough balls.
                        Cooking:
                        Heat a tawa (griddle) or a flat pan over medium-high heat. Once hot, place the rolled-out parotta on the tawa.
                        Cook the parotta for a few seconds until bubbles start to appear on the surface.
                        Flip the parotta and spread a little ghee or oil over the surface. Cook for another few seconds until both sides are golden brown and cooked through.
                        Remove the cooked parotta from the tawa and serve hot with your favorite curry or side dish.
