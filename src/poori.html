                        Ingredients:

                        2 cups whole wheat flour (atta)
                        1/2 teaspoon salt
                        Water, as needed
                        Oil, for deep-frying
                        Instructions:
                        
                        Preparing the Dough:
                        In a large mixing bowl, combine the whole wheat flour and salt.
                        Gradually add water little by little and knead the mixture into a smooth and soft dough. The dough should be firm but pliable.
                        Once the dough is well-kneaded, cover it with a damp cloth or plastic wrap and let it rest for about 15-20 minutes. This resting time helps in making the pooris soft and puff up when frying.
                        Dividing and Rolling:
                        After resting, divide the dough into equal-sized balls. Roll each ball between your palms to make them smooth.
                        Take one dough ball and flatten it slightly with your hands. Dip it in flour and place it on a clean, flat surface.
                        Using a rolling pin, roll out the dough ball into a thin, round disc. Try to roll it evenly into a circular shape.
                        Frying the Pooris:
                        Heat oil in a deep frying pan or kadai over medium-high heat. To check if the oil is hot enough, drop a small piece of dough into the oil; if it rises to the surface immediately, the oil is ready for frying.
                        Gently slide the rolled-out poori into the hot oil. It should puff up immediately.
                        Once the poori puffs up and turns golden brown on one side, flip it using a slotted spoon or spatula.
                        Fry the poori on the other side until it's golden brown and cooked through.
                        Remove the fried poori from the oil using a slotted spoon and drain excess oil by placing it on a paper towel-lined plate.
                        Repeat the process with the remaining dough balls.
                        Serving:
                        Serve the hot and crispy pooris with your favorite side dish such as potato masala, chana masala, or any curry of your choice.
