                    <p>
                        Ingredients:

1 cup rice
1/4 cup urad dal (split black gram)
1/4 cup chana dal (split chickpeas)
Salt, to taste
Water, as needed
Instructions:

Preparation:
Rinse the rice, urad dal, and chana dal separately under cold water until the water runs clear.
Soak the rice, urad dal, and chana dal in separate bowls with enough water to cover them. Let them soak for at least 4-6 hours, or preferably overnight.
Grinding:
After soaking, drain the water from each ingredient.
Grind the rice, urad dal, and chana dal separately into a smooth batter using a wet grinder or a high-powered blender. Add water as needed to achieve a smooth consistency. The batter should be slightly thick, similar to pancake batter.
Once ground, mix the rice batter, urad dal batter, and chana dal batter together in a large bowl. Add salt to taste and mix well. The batter should have a smooth and slightly thick consistency. Allow the batter to ferment overnight or for at least 8-12 hours. Fermentation helps in creating a tangy flavor and making the dosas more digestible.
Making Dosa:
Heat a non-stick or cast iron dosa tawa (griddle) over medium heat. Once hot, sprinkle a few drops of water on the tawa. If the water sizzles and evaporates immediately, the tawa is ready.
Stir the dosa batter well. Take a ladleful of batter and pour it onto the center of the tawa.
Using the back of the ladle, spread the batter in a circular motion to form a thin, even layer. Start from the center and work your way outwards.
Drizzle a little oil or ghee (clarified butter) around the edges of the dosa and on the top. This helps in achieving a crisp texture.
Cook the dosa on medium heat until the edges start to lift and turn golden brown, and the surface of the dosa appears cooked.
Flip the dosa using a spatula and cook for another 1-2 minutes on the other side until it turns golden brown and crisp.
Once cooked, transfer the dosa to a plate and serve hot with chutney, sambar, or any desired accompaniment.
Enjoy your delicious homemade dosa!
