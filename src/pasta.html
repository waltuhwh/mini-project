                        Ingredients:

                        8 ounces (about 225 grams) of pasta (e.g., spaghetti, penne, fusilli)
                        Salt, to taste
                        Water, for boiling
                        Olive oil (optional)
                        Pasta sauce of your choice (e.g., marinara, alfredo, pesto)
                        Grated Parmesan cheese (optional)
                        Fresh herbs (e.g., basil, parsley) for garnish (optional)
                        Instructions:
                        
                        Boiling the Pasta:
                        Fill a large pot with water and add salt to taste. Bring the water to a boil over high heat.
                        Once the water is boiling, add the pasta to the pot. Stir the pasta gently to prevent sticking.
                        Cook the pasta according to the package instructions or until al dente, which means it's cooked through but still slightly firm to the bite. This usually takes about 8-12 minutes, depending on the type of pasta.
                        Once the pasta is cooked, drain it in a colander, reserving some of the pasta cooking water if needed.
                        Preparing the Sauce:
                        While the pasta is cooking, you can prepare the pasta sauce of your choice. You can use store-bought sauce or make your own from scratch.
                        Heat the sauce in a separate saucepan over medium heat until it's heated through. You can also add any additional ingredients you like, such as cooked vegetables, meat, or seafood.
                        Combining the Pasta and Sauce:
                        Once the pasta and sauce are ready, you can combine them together.
                        Add the drained pasta to the saucepan with the heated sauce. Toss the pasta gently to coat it evenly with the sauce. You can also drizzle a little olive oil over the pasta for extra flavor, if desired.
                        Serving:
                        Once the pasta is well coated with the sauce, transfer it to serving plates or bowls.
                        Garnish the pasta with grated Parmesan cheese and fresh herbs, if desired.
                        Serve the pasta immediately while it's hot, and enjoy!
                        This simple pasta recipe can be customized with your favorite type of pasta and sauce, as well as any additional ingredients you like. It's a versatile and satisfying dish that's perfect for a quick and easy meal.
